                Fighting, Strength and Intellect. Some of the Marvel Overpower hero cards existed before the intellect stat was later added on.

                    <h2>Spider-Man</h2>
                    <p>Peter Benjamin Parker lost his parents, Richard and Mary Parker, at a young age. Orphaned as a toddler, he had to live with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May.
                        During a science exhibition, he was bitten by a Radioactive Spider, granting him his powers. He decided to use these powers for his own selfish gain, until his Uncle Ben died at the hands 
                        of a Burglar he could've stopped. It was at that point that he learned "With great power, there must also come great responsibility", and decided to live up to his uncle's mantra and use 
                        his powers as a force for good as Spider-Man. <br>Source: <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Peter_Parker_(Earth-616)">Spier-Man Fandom</a></p><br>

                    <h2>Iron Man</h2>
                    <p>Tony Stark is a genius inventor and billionaire industrialist, who suits up in his armor of cutting-edge technology to become the super hero Iron Man. The adopted son of weapons manufacturer 
                        Howard Stark, Tony inherited his family's company at a young age following his parents' death. While overseeing a manufacturing plant in a foreign country, Stark was kidnapped by 
                        local terrorists. Instead of giving in to his captors' demands to build weapons for them, Stark created a powerful suit of armor for himself to escape. Returning to America, 
                        Stark further upgraded the armor and put his vast resources and intellect to use for the betterment of the world as Iron Man.

                    <h2>Wolverine</h2>
                    <p>FJames Howlett was born to a wealthy Canadian family at the end of the 19th century, being the son of Mrs. Elizabeth Howlett and her husband's employee, Thomas Logan. He was forced to 
                        abandon his family after the tragic murder of his father, a situation which caused his mutant bestial abilities of accelerated healing factor, keenly enhanced senses and bone claws in 
                        each hand to manifest. Adopting the name Logan, he wandered the world, living a long life filled with blood, war and betrayal, having vile Sabretooth as his archenemy and the 
                        Japanese warrior Ogun as his sensei. Unfortunately, by always acting as a lone wolf, Logan was an unwitting subject of the Weapon X program and had his bones coated in indestructible 
                        Adamantium, becoming an even more lethal asset.[74] He was rescued and assisted by Mac and Heather Hudson, joining Department H as a Canadian government operative known as 
                        the Wolverine.

                    <h2>Venom</h2>
                    <p>A hulking and twisted distortion of Spider-Man, Venom is the result of an alien symbiote merged with a human holding a bitter grudge against Peter Parker. This combination has proven nearly 
                        lethal to the wall-crawler numerous times. Despite his hatred of Spider-Man, Venom has a twisted sense of morality, avoiding harming anyone he deems to be innocent and even performing 
                        heroic deeds. However, it is never clear how long Venom's darker impulses can be held in check. No matter how hard anyone tries to keep the symbiote down, Venom always manages to come back, 
                        like a plague.

            <h2>Power Cards</h2>
            <p>Power cards each consist of a number from 1 to 8 and a type, Energy, Fighting, Strength, Intellect, Multi-Power, or Any-Power. Power cards can be used as an attack of the level of the number, or as 
                a defense of the level of the number. A character can play a power card whenever their grid is high enough. For instance, a character with 6 energy could play any energy power card from 1-6, 
                but couldn't play 7s or 8s. (This requirement is the same on attack or defense.) Multipower power cards can be used in any of the types shown (either all four, or just Energy, Fighting, or Strength);
                 their type may be chosen as they are played. CLick on the card below to see some examples</p>
