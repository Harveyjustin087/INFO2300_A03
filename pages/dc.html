                <div id="batman" hidden>
                    <h2>Batman</h2>
                    <p>Batman has been Gotham City's protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League. Batman is a superhero co-created by 
                        artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger. The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne. Witnessing the 
                        murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave, 
                        beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth. The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most 
                        superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation 
                        in his war on crime. <br>Source: <a href="https://batman.fandom.com/wiki/Batman">Batman Wiki</a></p><br>

                    <h2>Superman</h2>
                    <p>Superman is a superhero published by DC Comics since 1938. An alien named Kal-El from the destroyed planet Krypton. He was sent to Earth and raised as Clark Kent by human foster parents, 
                        Martha and Jonathan Kent. As an adult, Superman became the protector of Earth, working at the Daily Planet as Clark Kent alongside his partner and wife Lois Lane.

                    <h2>Wonder Woman</h2>
                    <p>First Appearance: ALL STAR COMICS #8, 1941. One of the most beloved and iconic DC Super Heroes of all time, Wonder Woman has stood for nearly eighty years as a symbol of truth, 
                        justice and equality to people everywhere. Raised on the hidden island of Themyscira, also known as Paradise Island, Diana is an Amazon, like the figures of Greek legend, and 
                        her people's gift to humanity. As Themyscira's emissary to Man's World, Diana has made it her duty to lead by example, even if the differences between her birthplace and new home sometimes
                        present hurdles for her to jump. She has come to represent the possibility and potential of life without war, hate or violence, and she is a beacon of hope to all who find themselves in need. 
                        She stands an equal among the most powerful Super Heroes, with a sense of purpose to protect the world from injustice in all forms.

                    <h2>Harley Quinn</h2>
                    <p>Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel, also known as Harley Quinn (a pun on the word "harlequin"), first appeared in the Batman: The Animated Series episode "Joker's Favor", 
                        where she served as a humorous female sidekick to the Joker. In her first appearances she was depicted as a character completely devoted to the Joker, totally oblivious to his 
                        psychotic nature and obvious lack of affection for her; this characterization has remained more or less consistent throughout her subsequent appearances.

                    <h2>The Joker</h2>
                    <p>The Joker is a supervillain and the archenemy of Batman. He was first introduced in Batman #1 (Spring 1940) but faded into obscurity in the 1950s as a harmless prankster, 
                        starting in the early 1970s he was re-introduced as a more legitimate threat. The Joker is a master criminal with a clown-like appearance, and is considered one of the most infamous 
                        criminals within Gotham City. Initially portrayed as a violent sociopath who murders people for his own amusement, the Joker later in the 1940s began to be written as a goofy trickster-thief. 
                        That characterization continued through the late-1950s and 1960s before the character became again depicted as a vicious, calculating, psychopathic killer. The Joker has been responsible for 
                        numerous tragedies in Batman's life, including the paralysis of Barbara Gordon (Batgirl/Oracle), and the murders of Jason Todd (the second Robin) and Jim Gordon's second wife Sarah Essen.

            <h2>Power Cards</h2>
            <p>Power cards each consist of a number from 1 to 8 and a type, Energy, Fighting, Strength, Intellect, Multi-Power, or Any-Power. Power cards can be used as an attack of the level of the number, or as 
                a defense of the level of the number. A character can play a power card whenever their grid is high enough. For instance, a character with 6 energy could play any energy power card from 1-6, 
                but couldn't play 7s or 8s. (This requirement is the same on attack or defense.) Multipower power cards can be used in any of the types shown (either all four, or just Energy, Fighting, or Strength);
                 their type may be chosen as they are played. CLick on the card below to see some examples</p>
